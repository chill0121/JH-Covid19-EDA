### Data Source Information

This data was procured from <>

From the source:


### Environment Setup

First we will import the libraries in R that are needed.

Then, we will import the data using a URL directly from the source, this means it will update anytime we reknit.

```{r Setup RMD}
# Output all commands run and set a standard plot size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6)
# Import Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggmap)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
# Import dataset
